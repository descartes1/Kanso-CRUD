This app shows in a minimalistic way how the CRUD operation on CouchDB are made with the Kanso Framework.

You can do a login and a logout, add a new textphrase, change it and delete it.
No event handling, no error handling, no jquery. Just as simple as possible as a point to start for absolute newbies like me.

/* Short guide to make things running */

0. Things you have should done before:
- Installed CouchDB
- Installed Kanso

1. Go to https://github.com/descartes1/Kanso-CRUD

2. Download the source to your PC

3. Extract the archive you downloaded before

4. You now should the a folder thats named something like "descartes1-Kanso-CRUD-XYZ123"

5. Rename the folder to Kanso-CRUD

Your folder structure should now looks like

Kanso-CRUD (folder)
|
|-lib (folder)
|-static (folder)
|-templates (folder)
|-kanso.json (file)
|-README (file)

6. Open a shell/termial

7. "cd" into the Kanso-CRUD folder, eg. "cd ./Kanso-CRUD"

8. Execute "kanso autopush http://yourdbuser:yourdbpass@localhost:5984/crud".

Make sure, that your user has admin rights. If you don't have a databaseuser yet, you're probably in "Admin Party"-mode. See http://kansojs.org/guides/getting_started.html#users_and_permissions how to fix this.

If there is no database named crud in couchdb, it will be generated for you by kanso.

9. Go to http://localhost:5984/crud/_design/crud/_rewrite/ and enjoy.
